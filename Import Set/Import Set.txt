📘 Import Set 

Import Set in ServiceNow is used to load data from external sources (Excel, CSV, JDBC, etc.) into ServiceNow tables. It works through a staging table and a transform process.

🔹 Key Concepts
1. Import Set Table (Staging Table)

Temporary table where data is first loaded

Prefix: u_ or x_

Stores raw data exactly as uploaded

2. Transform Map

Rules for how data moves from Import Set Table ➝ Target Table

Defines field mapping, conditions, and scripts

3. Field Mapping

Connects source field → target field

Example: u_email → email

4. Coalesce

Helps avoid duplicate records

If a field is coalesced:

If match found → update

If no match → insert new record

5. Transform Scripts

onBefore → runs before every insert/update

onAfter → runs after record is inserted/updated

Script → custom logic to transform fields

6. Scheduled Imports

Automate data loading from external sources daily/weekly

Useful for HR, CMDB, vendor data, etc.

🔹 Import Workflow

Upload file (CSV/Excel)

Load in Import Set table

Create Transform Map

Map fields & set coalesce

Run Transform

Data moves to Target Table
