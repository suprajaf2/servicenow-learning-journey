# 📘 Practice Notes – UI Policies  
**Date:** 2025-11-16  
**Topic:** UI Policies & UI Policy Actions in ServiceNow

---

## 🏁 Overview
Today I practiced **UI Policies**, which allow dynamic form behavior without scripting.  
They are useful for:
- Making fields mandatory
- Showing or hiding fields
- Making fields read-only
- Running conditions based on field values

---

## 🛠️ What I Practiced Today

### ✔️ 1. Creating a UI Policy
- Opened: **System UI → UI Policies**
- Selected target table
- Added conditions  
- Enabled / Disabled reverse if false

---

## ✔️ 2. UI Policy Conditions I Used
I created multiple sample conditions:
Example-1

Scenario: If someone chooses Assigned To, they must also choose Assignment Group.
Condition:
Field: assigned_to
Operator: is not empty
UI Policy Action:
Field: assignment_group
Mandatory: True

Example 2:

Make Subcategory Mandatory When Category is Filled 
Scenario: If a user selects a Category, they must select a Subcategory. 
Condition: 
Field: category
Operator: is not empty
UI Policy Action: 
Field: subcategory 
Mandatory: True 
Visible: True how

Example 3

When State = Resolved, the Resolved Notes field should become visible and mandatory
Condition: State is Resolved
UI Policy Action: 
Field: Close_notes
Mandatory : True
Visible : True
Read-only : False
Reverse if false : Checked

## ✔️ 3. UI Policy Actions Created
For each policy, I configured:

- Mandatory: True/False  
- Read-only: True/False  
- Visible: True/False
