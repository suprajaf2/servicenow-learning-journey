## 🛠️ What I Practiced

### ✔️ 1. Creating a New Table
- Created a custom table using **Table → Create New**
- Configured:
  - Label  
  - Name  
  - Application scope  
  - Auto-number  
  - Extends table (optional)
- Set **User criteria** for form access  

### ✔️ 2. Adding Fields
Added multiple fields with proper data types:
- String  
- Integer  
- Choice  
- Reference  
- Date/Time  
- Email  
- True/False  

Configured field properties:
- Mandatory  
- Default value  
- Max length  
- Read-only  
- Display field  

Learned how each field creates a **dictionary entry**.
