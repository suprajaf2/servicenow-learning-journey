* Order Guide 

An Order Guide in ServiceNow allows users to order multiple related catalog items together in one request. It helps collect common information once and then generates multiple RITMs under a single REQ. Order Guides are mainly used for onboarding, hardware bundles, and access setup.

The Order Guide contains:

Guide variables (common fields the user fills once)

Included catalog items

Rules to decide which items should be shown based on user selections

When submitted, the Order Guide creates:

1 REQ (Request)

Multiple RITMs (one for each catalog item inside the guide)

Order Guides make ordering faster, avoid duplicate data entry, and ensure consistency in user requests
