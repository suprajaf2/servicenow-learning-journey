📘 Data Policy 

Data Policy in ServiceNow is used to enforce mandatory, read-only, and data validation rules at the server level, ensuring that only valid data enters the database.

🔹 Key Points

Works on server side (Import Sets, Integrations, APIs, Background scripts).

Can also run on forms if “Apply to UI” is checked.

Ensures data consistency across all data entry methods.

Similar to UI Policy but more powerful because it runs outside the UI.

🔹 Why We Use Data Policy

UI Policy works only on forms, but data may come from:

Import Sets

API integrations

Scripted inserts/updates

Data Policy makes rules universal across all data sources.

🔹 Typical Uses

Making fields mandatory (e.g., Email must always be filled).

Making fields read-only (e.g., State field controlled by workflow).

Validating imported or integrated data.

Enforcing rules during bulk data loads.

🔹 Difference from UI Policy
UI Policy	Data Policy
Client-side (browser)	Server-side
Works only on forms	Works on all data entries
Cannot control integration data	Controls all sources
Visible to user	Not visible to user
🔹 Example

Condition: Category = Laptop
Action: Make RAM, Storage, Model mandatory across UI + imports + integrations.

🔹 When to Convert UI Policy → Data Policy

When imported/migrated data must follow the same rules.

When API records must follow mandatory or read-only rules.
